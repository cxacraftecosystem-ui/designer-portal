/**
 * THE PASSWORD SCREENS THIS HANDSET DID NOT HAVE.
 *
 * ══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
 * WHAT WAS MISSING, IN THREE PARTS
 * ══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
 *
 * 1. **`mustChangePassword` WAS SET BY THE SERVER AND CONSUMED BY NO SCREEN — on either client.**
 *    `POST /api/users` creates an account with the flag, `serialize_user` carries it on all four
 *    doors, `POST /auth/change-password` is the route it names, and nothing anywhere called it. An
 *    account whose password an administrator typed — a secret two people know by construction —
 *    signed in, worked normally, and nobody was ever asked to replace it. [PasswordGateScreen] is
 *    this client's half; `FirstPasswordGate` in `frontend/app/login/page.tsx` is the web's.
 *
 * 2. **The redeem screen was web-only.** A designer sent a link opened it in a browser, which works.
 *    [SetPasswordLinkScreen] puts it in the app, because the link arrives in a chat app on the same
 *    phone this is installed on and the browser is a detour.
 *
 * 3. **An administrator could not issue one from the phone at all.** [IssuedPasswordLinkPanel] is
 *    the surface for that, mounted by the user-management card in `MainActivity`.
 *
 * ══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
 * THE GATE IS A `when` ARM AND NOT A DIALOG, FOR `UsageConsentGateScreen`'S REASON
 * ══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
 *
 * A dialog is dismissible and "set a password if you feel like it" is not the requirement. Read that
 * screen's header before changing the shape of this one: it argues at length why the enforcement
 * belongs between sign-in and the dashboard rather than behind a tap, and why the escape hatch
 * ("Sign out instead") is not a hedge — a person who genuinely cannot complete the step must not be
 * held on one screen whose controls all do nothing, and signing out returns them to a door they can
 * use with a different account without letting anybody INTO the product.
 *
 * ══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
 * SINCE 2026-10-09 THE SERVER REFUSES BEHIND THE GATE, AND THIS APP WAITS RATHER THAN FIGHTS IT
 * ══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
 *
 * While the flag is set, every route outside a short allow-list answers 401 with
 * `X-Password-Change-Required` — `data/PasswordChangeRequired.kt` has the list, and why it is a 401.
 * On this side that means three things:
 *
 *  * **The session is kept.** A gated 401 is a live session owing a password, not a dead one, so
 *    nothing signs out on it; a gated answer to ANY request re-reads the profile and puts the gate
 *    up, which is how a flag this handset had not heard about still reaches the screen.
 *  * **The background sends wait.** The outbox loop, the design-workshop pass and the join-card
 *    flusher hold back while the flag is set and start again the moment it clears. Nothing queued is
 *    touched: a 401 is "try again later" to every queue in this app.
 *  * **Builds 0.0.2 to 0.0.5 have no gate screen,** so their users change the password on the web
 *    first. That cost was accepted when the server started refusing.
 *
 * And one thing the same day changed about the change itself: it retires the session it was sent
 * with. So a change whose ANSWER is lost may well have landed, and a retry of it meets "This session
 * is no longer valid". The gate therefore asks before it speaks — `GET /me` with the session it
 * holds — and never says "nothing has changed" on the strength of a missing answer alone; see
 * [passwordGateAfterFailure]. The change is also sent once and only once: `ApiClient` marks its body
 * one-shot, so OkHttp cannot quietly send a second copy after the first one landed.
 *
 * ══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
 * THE LINK IS SHOWN ONCE. THIS FILE MUST NOT MAKE IT TWICE.
 * ══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
 *
 * `POST /auth/password-links` returns the LINK and deliberately no separate `token` field, on the
 * canonical route's stated grounds that a credential appearing twice in one answer is a credential in
 * two places to keep out of logs. There is no route that re-reads one. So [IssuedPasswordLinkPanel]
 * holds it in composable state and nowhere else — not in `TokenStore`, not in a preference, not in a
 * log line — and says on screen that closing the panel loses it. That sentence is not decoration: an
 * administrator who dismisses without copying has to issue another, and the throttle is per SUBJECT,
 * so doing that four times in an hour locks the person they are trying to help out of being helped.

/* ══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
 * 1. The gate between sign-in and the dashboard
 * ══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════ */

/**
 * BETWEEN SIGN-IN AND THE PRODUCT, while this account owes a new password.
 *
 * ── THE CURRENT PASSWORD IS CARRIED FORWARD, NOT ASKED FOR TWICE ─────────────────────────────────
 *
 * `POST /auth/change-password` requires it even for an account carrying the flag, and the server is
 * right to insist: the flag means "the password you hold must be replaced", not "anybody holding
 * this handset may replace it". On the ordinary path the person typed it into the sign-in card
 * seconds ago, so [doorPassword] hands it over and the box never appears. It IS asked for where this
 * app is not holding one — a Google sign-in, a session that was already open when the app was
 * launched or when the gate arrived — because the alternative is a gate whose only button cannot
 * succeed; and it appears after the server has refused the carried one, for the same reason (see
 * [passwordGateAsksForCurrentAfter]).
 *
 * ── AND IT NEVER READS THE PASSWORD BACK OUT OF ANYWHERE ─────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * [doorPassword] is a parameter and dies with the composable. `TokenStore` holds a JWT and a profile
 * and has never held a password; nothing here starts. A handset in this fleet is shared, and a
 * credential that outlived the screen would be one the next person could reach.

                                      `changeOwnPassword` refreshes the cached profile as part of

                                      The write has landed by this point; the flag is the only thing
                                      that has not caught up, and clearing it is the honest reading of

 * 2. Redeeming an administrator's link, on the handset
 * ══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════ */

/**
 * THE SCREEN AT THE END OF AN ADMINISTRATOR'S PASSWORD LINK, for somebody who cannot sign in.
 *
 * ── IT IS REACHED FROM THE SIGN-IN CARD, WHICH IS THE ONLY PLACE IT CAN BE ───────────────────────
 *
 * The whole point of holding a link is that you cannot sign in, so this cannot live behind the
 * navigation drawer or anywhere else inside the app. `MainActivity` renders it INSTEAD OF
 * `LoginScreen` while it is open, and the way back is a button on it.
 *
 * ── THE LINK IS PASTED, OR NOW ALSO TAPPED, AND THE BOX IS THE SAME EITHER WAY ───────────────────
 *
 * See [passwordLinkToken]. A link tapped in a chat app used to open a browser only — which works,
 * and is a detour for somebody standing in a courtyard with this app already open. `AndroidManifest`
 * now offers this app for those links as well, and a tap arrives here through [initialLink] with the
 * whole URL already in the box, so the check fires without anybody copying anything.
 *
 * THE PASTE BOX IS NOT SUPERSEDED BY THAT AND MUST NOT BE REMOVED. The filter is a plain one and
 * not a verified App Link (its comment in the manifest says what a verified one would owe), so it
 * offers a CHOOSER rather than taking the link; it names one host, so a deployment serving the web
 * app from anywhere else never matches it at all; and a link read out over a telephone or copied off
 * a note was never a tap in the first place. Every one of those still ends at this box.
 *
 * ── A FAILED CHECK IS NOT A DEAD LINK ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * `GET /auth/set-password` is asked first because its six reason words are the only way to say
 * WHICH refusal this is — expired, withdrawn, already used — and "invalid link" leaves a person with
 * no next action. But a check that could not be MADE says nothing about the link: the phone may
 * simply have no signal, and telling somebody their link is dead when it has not been examined sends
 * them back to an administrator for nothing. So a thrown check is treated as unknown, the form is
 * offered, and the POST is the authority either way. The web screen takes the identical position.
 *
 * ── AND THE SERVER DELIBERATELY DOES NOT SAY WHOSE ACCOUNT IT IS ─────────────────────────────────
 *
 * No email, no name, no role, on either route. This is reachable by anybody with a guess, and a body
 * that named the account would turn a forged-token probe into an account lookup. Nothing on this
 * screen may print an identity, because there is none to print.

 *  * **The link is also on screen and selectable**, so a clipboard the platform refuses is not the
 *    end of the road.
 *  * **Withdraw is offered beside Copy**, because "I pasted that into the wrong window" is the case
