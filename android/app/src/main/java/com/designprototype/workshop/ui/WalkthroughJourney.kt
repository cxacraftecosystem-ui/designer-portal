/*
 * ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * THE WALKTHROUGH AS A JOURNEY: ONE SCROLL, A SPINE THAT FILLS AS YOU READ, AND A CARD PER STEP.
 *
 * `WalkthroughSteps.kt` holds the words. `WalkthroughScreen.kt` holds the window, the seen-flag and
 * the exits. This file holds the EXPERIENCE — the thing the owner actually asked for when they said
 * the handset's walkthrough "is nowhere as good as the walkthrough on web".
 *
 * ── WHY A DECK OF CARDS COULD NOT BE MADE GOOD ENOUGH ────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * What shipped before this was twenty-five pages behind a Next button. Every fact on it was right and
 * it still was not the web's walkthrough, because the web's walkthrough is not a list of facts — it
 * is a JOURNEY you travel down with your thumb, and the travelling is the teaching. A reader on
 * `/guide` sees a purple spine grow beside the cards as they scroll, a dot riding down it, a ring
 * closing in the corner. What they learn from that is not any one step: it is that the steps are IN
 * AN ORDER and that they are somewhere in it. A paged dialog cannot say that. Next is a door closing
 * behind you: you cannot see where you came from, you cannot skim ahead, and "step 14 of 23" is a
 * number you are told rather than a distance you can feel. That is the whole gap, and no amount of
 * better copy on a card closes it.
 *
 * ── WHAT WAS COPIED FROM THE WEB, MECHANIC FOR MECHANIC ──────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * `frontend/components/guide/GuideJourney.tsx` — the scroll-linked spine: one value driving a fill,
 * a travelling node and a progress readout, none of which re-render React. `GuideStepCard.tsx` — the
 * once-only reveal, the numbered bubble, the expandable detail panel, the chevron. `GuideRail.tsx` —
 * the ring, the hard-rounded percent and the trick that keeps it under a hundred renders.
 *
 * ── AND THE ONE THING THAT WAS DELIBERATELY NOT COPIED: THE RAIL ─────────────────────────────────
 *
 * The web's sticky rail — the 260px column with the ring, the percent, the active-step readout and
 * the clickable step list — is `hidden lg:block`. It does not exist below 1024px. `GuideRail.tsx`
 * says so in its own first sentence: "large screens only — on phones the spine alone carries the
 * reader". So a phone reader on the web gets the hero, the spine, the cards and the outro, and
 * nothing else, and copying the rail onto a 360dp handset would not be parity — it would be
 * inventing a third design neither client has.
 *
 * There is one divergence from that, it is deliberate, and it is written down here rather than left
 * to be discovered. The rail's CONTENT — where am I, out of how many — is not rail furniture; it is
 * the answer to the question this whole surface exists to answer, and the web reader gets it for
 * free from a page header that says "…{N} steps, in the order you do them" sitting above the fold.
 * A dialog has no page header. So one slim, non-scrolling row is pinned at the top of this screen
 * carrying exactly the rail's content and nothing else: the ring, the percent, the step counter, the
 * active step's name and Skip. Laid out horizontally, because a phone's spare axis is horizontal. It
 * is about 64dp of chrome instead of a 260dp column, and it must NOT be allowed to grow a step-list
 * navigator — that is the part of the rail with genuinely no room, and the web's own copy of it has
 * a height ceiling with a comment explaining which five rows it silently swallowed the last time
 * somebody added chrome above it.
 *
 * ── NOTHING HERE AWAITS A REQUEST ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * No repository, no coroutine that fetches, no suspend call except the two that scroll. The steps are
 * a compiled-in `listOf` and the icons ship in the APK, because the fortnight this describes happens
 * in courtyards with no bar of signal.
 * ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

/*
 * `--guide-rail`, IN KOTLIN. The web sets one CSS variable on the step list and derives four things
 * from it: the width of each card's first grid column, and the box the track, the fill and the
 * travelling node are centred in. The comment on `GuideJourney.tsx` records what it replaced —
 * "three independent guesses reconciled by `-translate-x-1/2`" — and that the guesses had already
 * broken in production, every numbered bubble sitting a full half-width right of the spine it was
 * supposed to be on.
 *
 * Compose has no inline-transform trap to fall into, but the one-owner rule is not about transforms:
 * it is about a number that four call sites have to agree on — the gutter every step card leaves on
 * its left, and the x the spine's track, fill and travelling node are all drawn on, which is half of
 * it. The web's own mobile value is 2rem of rail plus a 1rem gap; 44dp is that, and it doubles as the
 * left margin of the screen, so there is no second inset for the two of them to disagree about.
 *
 * WHICH IS WHY THIS CONSTANT IS A FLOOR AND NOT THE FIGURE ITSELF. The bubble's diameter follows the
 * reader's font scale (see [WALK_BUBBLE_TEXT] below), so the gutter has to be able to grow with it.
 * The single owner is therefore the `railWidth` local in [WalkthroughJourney], computed once from this
 * floor and from the bubble and handed to the spine and to every row. Nothing else in this file may
 * work out a rail width of its own, and nothing may go back to reading this constant directly.
 */

/*
 * THE NUMBERED BUBBLE, SIZED FROM ITS OWN TEXT RATHER THAN PINNED TO A NUMBER OF DP.
 *
 * An earlier version of this file was a flat `30.dp` under a comment claiming the two-digit steps
 * "still centre inside it at any font scale". They do not, and the arithmetic is worth writing down
 * so nobody flattens it back. `ProvideAppPreferences` multiplies the reader's own system font scale by
 * another 1.125 when "Larger text" is on, so a designer reading at the platform's 2x is really at
 * 2.25x, and 12.sp of digits is then 27dp tall. Two of them are about 32dp wide. A `Modifier.size`
 * hands its child FIXED constraints, so "23" in a 30dp box is not a snug fit — it is measured at 30dp,
 * and with `maxLines = 1` and the default `TextOverflow.Clip` the second digit is cut in half. Step
 * numbers are the one thing on this screen a reader cannot recover from context.
 *
 * So the diameter is derived from the text the way [WalkthroughProgressRing] derives its own, by
 * asking the density what the reader's scale actually is instead of guessing. The multiplier is
 * chosen so that AT THE DEFAULT SCALE THE ANSWER IS EXACTLY [WALK_BUBBLE_MIN] — 12dp times 2.5 is
 * 30dp — which means this changes nothing for the reader who has not touched their font size, and
 * grows only for the reader who has. The ceiling keeps it a bubble rather than a saucer.

 * of the twenty-three journey steps write exactly that. The other two raise their voice instead:
 * "…all on the device. WATCH OUT, BECAUSE THIS ONE COSTS SOMEBODY ELSE'S WORK: a queued CORRECTION to
 * an existing record replaces that record whole" (`offline`) and "…recorded in the earlier steps.
 * WATCH OUT, AND THIS IS THE ONE TO REMEMBER: choosing a record COPIES its values onto this stage"
 * (`design-workshop-stages`). A comma is not a colon, so `indexOf("Watch out:", ignoreCase = true)`
 * answered -1 for both, [walkthroughFacets] handed the card an empty `watch` list, and the card —
 * correctly, by its own rule that a heading is never drawn over an empty block — rendered NO "Watch
 * out for" section at all. The warning did not vanish; it stayed buried in the last third of the
 * "Why this step exists" prose, with no heading, no bullet and no icon over it. On the web both are
 * `watch[]` entries under a triangle.
 *
 * WHAT MAKES THAT WORSE THAN AN ORDINARY LAYOUT BUG is which two steps drew it. Every step's caution
 * is the half a skimmer still takes in; these two are the ones that cost somebody ELSE's fortnight —
 * a queued correction overwriting a colleague's edits with nobody told, and a reference pick copying
 * values that a later edit does not rewrite. And nothing could see it: `WalkthroughStepsTest` asks
 * whether the body `contains("watch out", ignoreCase = true)`, which is true of both, so the suite
 * was green while the section it was standing guard over was not being drawn.
 *
 * SO THE CONTRACT IS THE WORDS AND NOT THE PUNCTUATION. A step may lead with a colon, a comma, a
 * dash or a clause of its own before the colon — whatever it leads with is kept, because
 * "BECAUSE THIS ONE COSTS SOMEBODY ELSE'S WORK: a queued correction…" reads correctly under a
 * "Watch out for" heading and rewriting it to fit a parser would be a machine editing copy. The
 * separators are consumed so a bullet never opens on a stray comma. `\b` on both ends so a body that
 * ever says "watchtower" or "outbox" cannot be mistaken for a seam.

/**
 * Where every card sits in the scrolling content, and the three answers derived from that.
 *
 * ── WHY THIS IS A CLASS AND NOT FOUR LOCALS ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * Every number here is read from two places that are not composition — a `drawBehind` lambda and a
 * `derivedStateOf` calculation — and the whole performance argument below rests on the reads
 * happening THERE and not in the composable. A remembered object with methods is the shape that makes
 * that hard to get wrong by accident: there is no way to "just read the value" at the call site,
 * because there is no value at the call site.
 *
 * ── THE PERFORMANCE ARGUMENT, WHICH IS THE POINT OF THE WHOLE FILE ───────────────────────────────
 *
 * A scrolling page changes its offset on every frame. If a composable read `scrollState.value` in its
 * own composition, every one of those frames would invalidate it — and on this screen that composable
 * is a Column holding twenty-five cards, so a single flick would recompose twenty-five cards sixty
 * times a second on a handset that has other things to do. `AppNavigation.rememberIslandScrolledPast`
 * already argues this for the island bar and states the payoff in as many words: the read happens
 * inside `derivedStateOf`, which makes the scroll state a dependency of ONE derived value and of
 * nothing else in the tree, and because that value only PUBLISHES when it actually changes, "scrolling
 * a thousand pixels therefore recomposes the bar exactly twice … and recomposes nothing else, ever."
 *
 * That is the Compose spelling of what the web means by "one MotionValue, three consumers, none of
 * them re-render React". The consumers here divide the same way:
 *
 *   the spine's fill and its travelling node   →  read [progress] inside `Modifier.drawBehind`, which
 *                                                 REPAINTS without recomposing or re-laying-out
 *                                                 anything. `MapScreen` makes the identical argument
 *                                                 for its row flash: a repaint of one row, not a
 *                                                 recomposition per frame.
 *   the percent, the ring and the active-step  →  read through `derivedStateOf` which publishes an
 *                                                 Int. There are 101 reachable percentages, so the
 *                                                 header costs at most a hundred recompositions for
 *                                                 the entire page, which is exactly the ceiling the
 *                                                 web buys with its rounded `useMotionValueEvent`.
 *
 * ── AND WHY THE HEIGHTS ARE SNAPSHOTTED RATHER THAN THE POSITIONS ────────────────────────────────
 *
 * `onGloballyPositioned` fires on every scrolled frame, because a scroll moves every card. That makes
 * it the wrong tool for "where does this card sit in the content" and `DwRankableList` rejects it for
 * this exact reason before using it for something else. A card's HEIGHT, on the other hand, changes
 * only when the card changes — when its panel opens, or when the text reflows at a new font scale —
 * so `onSizeChanged` writing a height that is guarded by an equality check writes a handful of times
 * per session and never once during a scroll. Tops are then accumulated from the heights, in order,
 * which is exact because every child of the scrolling Column is one of these rows and each row's
 * measured height already includes the gap under it.
 *
 * The honest cost, which is not a defect and must not be "fixed": opening a card changes the height
 * of the content, so the denominator moves and the fill shifts a little under the reader at that
 * instant. The web has precisely the same property — `useScroll` re-measures its target when the list
 * grows — and the alternative, latching a denominator taken before the expansion, would make the fill
 * report a distance that is no longer there.

/**
 * One step's body, cut into the pieces a card actually lays out.
 *
 * ── WHY THIS IS DERIVED RATHER THAN STORED, TODAY ────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * The web's `GuideStep` carries nine fields and three of them are the ones a card needs to lay out
 * separately: `summary` (the collapsed line), `why` (the panel's prose) and `watch[]` (the cautions).
 * [WalkStep] carries the same material in one string, and the KDoc over [WalkStep.body] states the
 * contract that makes it separable: "four blocks in one paragraph, always in this order … and then —
 * introduced by the words 'Watch out:' — the thing that has actually gone wrong for somebody." That
 * order "is the durable half of the contract between the two clients".
 *
 * So this reads the seam the prose already has rather than inventing one, and it MOVES sentences
 * instead of writing them. Nothing here rewords anything: the summary is the body's own first
 * sentence and the caution is the body's own tail, both verbatim. That matters more than it looks
 * like it does — `WalkthroughSteps.kt` spends a paragraph on the five occasions the web's cautions
 * were written from a neighbour's copy instead of from the source and were therefore false, and a
 * paraphrase generated here would be exactly that failure with a machine doing the paraphrasing.
 *
 * ── AND WHY IT IS THE SEAM RATHER THAN THE DESTINATION ───────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * When [WalkStep] grows real `summary` and `watch` fields, this function is the one place that has to
 * change and the card above it does not have to change at all. That is the whole reason it exists as
 * a function with a return type rather than as three expressions inlined into the card.
 *
 * ── WHAT IS DELIBERATELY ABSENT: THE WEB'S `fields[]` ────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * The web's third panel section lists "the real form labels, in screen order, with (required)
 * marked". There is no Android counterpart and there must not be one invented here. Those are the
 * WEB'S labels in the WEB'S screen order; four of the web's own cards already cannot obey the rule
 * and carry section descriptions instead; and enumerating twenty-three Android forms from this file
 * would be copy written from copy, which is the failure both walkthrough files exist to prevent. A
 * step whose screen is one tap away does not need its fields transcribed — it needs the button, and
 * it has one. The card renders no heading for a block it has nothing to put under.

/**
 * Whether the reader is exploring by touch — TalkBack and its kind — kept live while this is open.
 *
 * ── WHY A SCROLL-LINKED REVEAL HAS TO ASK THIS, AND THE CLAIM THAT USED TO STAND HERE ────────────
 *
 * The reveal in [WalkthroughRow] fades each card in as it arrives, by writing `alpha` inside a
 * `graphicsLayer` lambda. An earlier version of that comment argued the reveal was therefore safe for
 * a screen reader, on the grounds that the cards "are ALWAYS in the composition and always in the
 * semantics tree" and that alpha "alters how the row is PAINTED and nothing about whether it exists".
 * The first half is true. The second half is false, and it is false in exactly the way that costs a
 * blind reader the page.
 *
 * Compose decides what to tell the accessibility framework about a node with
 * `SemanticsUtils.isVisible`, which is `!isTransparent && !contains(InvisibleToUser)`, and hands the
 * answer to `AccessibilityNodeInfoCompat.setVisibleToUser`. `SemanticsNode.isTransparent` asks its
 * coordinator, and `NodeCoordinator.isTransparent` is, in as many words, "this coordinator has a layer
 * whose last alpha was at or below zero, OR the coordinator that wraps it is transparent". A
 * `graphicsLayer` holding `alpha = 0f` therefore reports NOT VISIBLE TO USER for itself and, because
 * that walk goes up through every parent, for every descendant inside it. TalkBack filters exactly
 * that flag out of its traversal order. So a card that has not been revealed yet is precisely as
 * absent to a screen reader as it would have been under an `AnimatedVisibility` — the very failure the
 * old comment was congratulating itself on avoiding. A sighted reader would have seen a walkthrough of
 * twenty-three steps and a TalkBack reader the two or three that happened to fit the first screen.
 *
 * ── SO THE REVEAL IS SWITCHED OFF RATHER THAN WORKED AROUND ──────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * There is no way to keep the fade and keep the semantics: the transparency test is structural, it
 * reads the layer rather than anything this file could annotate, and floors the alpha at some
 * not-quite-zero value would be a card painted at two percent opacity, which is a lie to the sighted
 * reader in exchange for a truth to the blind one. When somebody is exploring by touch, every row is
 * simply revealed from the start, which is the same branch reduced motion already takes.
 *
 * ── `isTouchExplorationEnabled` AND NOT `isEnabled` ──────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * `isEnabled` is true when ANY accessibility service is running, and on a real handset that includes
 * password managers, clipboard tools and automation apps whose users can see the screen perfectly
 * well. Switching the animation off for them would be turning off a feature on a guess. Touch
 * exploration is the narrow question actually being asked here: does the reader reach this content by
 * moving focus through nodes rather than by scrolling with a thumb?
 *
 * ── AND IT IS OBSERVED RATHER THAN SAMPLED ONCE ──────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * [walkthroughReduceMotion] reads its setting once per `Context` and says why that is the right trade:
 * an IPC per frame is not worth a page turn, and nobody changes their animator scale mid-dialog. This
 * one is the opposite case and must not copy that shape. TalkBack has a volume-key shortcut and is
 * routinely turned on WHILE an app is open — by the one reader for whom a stale answer here means a
 * walkthrough with three steps in it. So a listener is registered for as long as the composable is
 * alive, and removed with it.

     * on screen shows. `Column` is an INLINE composable, so its content lambda has no restart scope of
     * its own: the body below is part of THIS function's scope, twenty-five rows and all. Passing
     * `percent` and `activeIndex` as Int arguments to [WalkthroughHeader] therefore performed both
     * snapshot reads HERE, which made a scroll invalidate the scope that emits every card. The cost
     * was not a redraw: `percent` has 101 reachable values and `activeIndex` twenty-three, so one pass
     * down the journey rebuilt this Column's modifier chain and re-issued all twenty-five (skippable)
     * row calls about a hundred and twenty times — and on a fling those hundred and twenty land inside
     * the second or so the fling lasts, which is one to three per FRAME on the SM-M325F this fleet

     * `useMotionValueEvent` and its `useTransform`-ed ring.
     *
     * `revealedThrough` STAYS READ HERE, and that is not an oversight. A row's reveal is a
     * `targetValue` handed to `animateFloatAsState`, which has to be read in composition to start an
     * animation at all — there is no draw-phase spelling of "this card has arrived". It publishes at

 * The dialog this replaces put `liveRegion = Polite` on its counter, and that was right THERE: a page

 * the READER scrolled, roughly two dozen times per pass, and announcing every change would interrupt
 * a screen-reader user two dozen times a page to tell them what they just did. The web reached the
 * same conclusion for the same node and its own accessibility contract states it: "There is
 * deliberately no `aria-live` on the rail … announcing it would interrupt a screen-reader user ten
 * times per page for information they already have." The information is not dropped, it is moved to
 * where a reader meets it: every numbered bubble carries "Step n of m" as its own description, so a
 * TalkBack reader is told the position of each step as they arrive at it, and the ring below reports
 * the same progress as a proper progress semantic when they focus it. That is one announcement per
 * step, attached to the step, instead of two dozen from a node nobody is looking at.

 * There is a number inside it. A box sized in dp with text sized in sp is a box the text outgrows the
 * moment the reader turns their font size up — and this app multiplies the system font scale by
 * another 1.125 of its own when "Larger text" is on, so it gets there sooner than most. Converting a
 * text size to dp asks the density what the reader's scale actually is instead of guessing, which is
 * the same move `rememberIslandWidths` makes when it measures the nav bar's words rather than pricing
 * them at "~7.5dp a character". The clamp keeps it a ring rather than a dinner plate.
 *
 * ── AND THE READING ARRIVES AS A LAMBDA, WHICH IS THE WHOLE OF THIS SCREEN'S SCROLL BUDGET ───────
 *
 * @param percent the journey's progress, unwrapped INSIDE this composable and nowhere above it. It is
 *   a scroll-driven value with a hundred and one reachable states, and the scope that reads it is the
 *   scope that recomposes: read here, that is this Box and the one `Text` in it; read one level up in
 *   [WalkthroughHeader] it would also be the header Row, and two levels up in [WalkthroughJourney] it
 *   would be the twenty-five-row Column, because `Column` is inline and shares its caller's scope.
 *   This is the Compose spelling of the web rail's `useMotionValueEvent` + hard-rounded `setPercent`,
 *   whose own comment gives the same ceiling in the same words: "at most 100 times across the whole
 *   page rather than once per scroll frame".

 * A step's dot and its card, side by side in the gutter the spine is drawn in.
 *
 * ── THE REVEAL: THE DOT ARRIVES, THEN THE CARD ───────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * The web reveals a card once, when a quarter of it has come into view, and staggers four children
 * inside it — icon tile, label row, summary, chevron — which its own comment calls "the reading
 * order, enforced in time". This does the same thing one level up: the numbered dot fades and rises
 * first and the card follows [WALK_CARD_DELAY_MS] later, which is the reading order of a row rather
 * than of a card and costs two animations per step instead of five. Twenty-five cards times five
 * `graphicsLayer` nodes is a real bill on a mid-range handset for a forty-millisecond difference
 * nobody has ever described.
 *
 * ── THE REVEAL IS PAINT, WHICH BUYS A GREAT DEAL AND DOES NOT BUY ACCESSIBILITY ──────────────────
 *
 * Alpha and a ten-dp offset, both written inside a `graphicsLayer` lambda. That keeps the whole thing
 * off the layout pass — they are properties of the layer, so nothing is measured again while it plays
 * — and it keeps every card in the composition, where an `AnimatedVisibility` would have removed the
 * ones below the fold outright.
 *
 * IT DOES NOT, HOWEVER, KEEP THEM VISIBLE TO A SCREEN READER, and an earlier version of this comment
 * claimed that it did. `NodeCoordinator.isTransparent` treats a layer at `alpha <= 0f` as transparent
 * and propagates that up through every parent, and Compose turns it straight into
 * `setVisibleToUser(false)`, which is the flag TalkBack filters its traversal on. An unrevealed card
 * is therefore just as unreachable as a removed one. That is not worked around here; it is switched
 * off at the source — [walkthroughScreenReaderActive] makes `revealed` true for every row the moment
 * somebody is exploring by touch, so this animation simply does not run for the reader it would have
 * cost. The full argument, including why floors and fudges were rejected, is on that function.

 * `GuideStepCard.tsx` marks its bubble `aria-hidden`, and that is right there: the cards are `<li>`
 * inside an `<ol>`, so a screen reader announces "list item 3 of 19" out of the STRUCTURE and the
 * painted number would be a second copy of a fact the document already carries. A Compose `Column`
 * carries no such structure. Hiding this dot would therefore take the position with it and leave a
 * TalkBack reader working from a smaller truth than the sighted reader beside them — which is the
 * rule `DwGalleryFloor` states for its own counts. So the dot is described, once, with the sentence
 * the number means, and it sits immediately before the card it numbers so the two are read in order.
 *
 * `clearAndSetSemantics` rather than a bare description because the "3" inside it would otherwise be
 * a second node reading a bare digit. And this dot is OUTSIDE the card's own clickable node, so the
 * description cannot collide with the card's label the way a merged child's would.
 *
 * The scale on expansion is the web's `animate={{ scale: expanded && !reduce ? 1.12 : 1 }}` and it is
 * pinned to 1 under reduced motion, where the panel opening under it is the thing that says which
 * card is open.

 * One step: a head you can press, and a detail panel that opens under it.

 * ── ONE CARD OPEN AT A TIME, AND THE FIRST OPEN ON ARRIVAL ───────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * Both are the web's behaviour and the second is the one that matters: a reader who arrives at a page
 * of twenty-three shut cards has to DISCOVER that they open, and a shape that has to be discovered is
 * a shape most people never see.
 *
 * ── WHAT ANSWERS A PRESS, IN THE THREE PLACES IT HAS TO BE ANSWERED ──────────────────────────────
 *
 * `stateDescription` says "Expanded" / "Collapsed"; `onClickLabel` says what the press will DO; and
 * [Role.Button] says what kind of thing this is. The chevron says none of the three to somebody who
 * cannot see it, which is why it is decoration on top of them rather than instead of them —
 * `DwPanelDisclosureHeader` had this exact argument out three cards at a time and it is the app's
 * settled position. `clickable` and never `selectable`: a disclosure is not a choice among options,
 * and "selected / not selected" tells a reader nothing about the fact that pressing reveals something.
 *
 * The web's equivalent is a conditional `aria-controls` — pointed at the panel only while the panel
 * is in the document, because "pointing at an id that is not there is worse than not pointing". There
 * is no `aria-controls` in Compose and none is invented here: the state description carries the same
 * fact and carries it in both states.
 *
 * ── AND THE HEADINGS ARE CONDITIONAL ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * A section is drawn only if it has something in it. The web's card renders "What the screen asks
 * for" and "Watch out for" unconditionally over `.map` calls that can both be empty, which is a
 * heading with nothing under it waiting to happen on the first step that has no caution. Two ends of
 * this deck genuinely have none.

             *
             * The web animates `height: 0 → auto` inside an `AnimatePresence` and clips the panel —
             * only the panel — because the height animation needs it. `AnimatedVisibility` with
             * `expandVertically` is the same thing with the clip already inside it, which is why the
             * CARD is not clipped by anything this file adds: the web's rule about that exists
             * because its focus ring is an outline drawn two pixels OUTSIDE the border box and
             * clipping the card would erase it on three sides. Compose's own focus and press
             * indication is a state layer drawn inside the control, so the same hazard does not
             * exist here, and the card's own Material surface clip is what keeps a ripple from
             * painting over a rounded corner.
             *
             * Under reduced motion this collapses to `snap()` and is NOT removed. The panel is
             * content, not decoration; what the preference asks for is that it stop sliding.
