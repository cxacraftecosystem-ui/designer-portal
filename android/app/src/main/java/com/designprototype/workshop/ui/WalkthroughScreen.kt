 * ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * THE WALKTHROUGH'S WINDOW, THE FLAG THAT OPENS IT ONCE, AND NOTHING ELSE.
 *
 * Three files, one feature. `WalkthroughSteps.kt` holds the words. `WalkthroughJourney.kt` holds the
 * experience — the scroll, the spine, the cards. This one holds the WINDOW they are drawn in, the
 * exits, and the device-local "you have seen this" flag. The split is deliberate and it is the
 * reason the step list can be read by a JVM unit test that never stands up a composition — a step
 * list nothing can see is a step list that drifts, and the twelve steps these files replace drifted
 * seven behind the web without one thing in either client noticing.
 *
 * ── WHAT CHANGED HERE, AND WHY THE WINDOW DID NOT ────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * This used to be a deck: an `ElevatedCard` with one step on it and a Next button. Every fact on it
 * was right and it still was not the web's walkthrough, because the web's is a journey you scroll
 * down with a spine filling beside you, and a paged card cannot say "these are in an order and you
 * are somewhere in it" — see the argument at the top of `WalkthroughJourney.kt`, which is where that
 * whole surface now lives.
 *
 * What was fighting the journey was the CARD, not the Dialog. The window here was already
 * `usePlatformDefaultWidth = false`, and a Dialog is its own window: its content is the root of a
 * fresh composition subtree with no scrolling parent, so a full-height scroller inside it is bounded
 * by the window and is perfectly legal — the same reason `MediaPlayers` puts a `fillMaxSize` Box in
 * one and `SearchableSelect` puts a `LazyColumn` in a modal sheet. So the `ElevatedCard` became a
 * `Surface(fillMaxSize())` and everything below this comment stayed exactly as it was.
 *
 * ⚠ AND THE WINDOW IS DELIBERATELY LEFT FITTING THE SYSTEM DECOR. `decorFitsSystemWindows = false`
 * exists on the classpath and `DwQrLiveScanner` uses it, but `WindowInsets` appears NOWHERE else
 * under `src/main` — this app has never paid insets by hand. Going edge-to-edge here would draw the
 * pinned header under the status bar and Skip under the gesture pill on every tall handset, with no
 * established helper anywhere in the tree to fix it.
 *
 * ── WHY THIS IS A DIALOG AND NOT A `Screen` ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * It is tempting to give onboarding a screen of its own, and it would be wrong. `MainActivity`'s
 * `navigate` puts an unsaved-changes guard in front of every destination, and it EXEMPTS the
 * walkthrough by name, because the walkthrough draws OVER the page you were already on and takes
 * nothing away from it. Turn this into a `Screen` and re-opening the walkthrough from the menu — the
 * thing a designer does when they are halfway through an artisan form and cannot remember whether
 * Do's and Don'ts is one lesson per line — starts asking whether to throw the form away. It would
 * also cost three more exhaustive `when` tables (`headerTitle`, `currentDestination`, `goBack`) for
 * a surface that has no back stack of its own.
 *
 * So: `NavDestination.WALKTHROUGH` sets a boolean, this dialog reads it, and the page underneath is
 * untouched the whole time. That is also what makes the "where do Skip and Done land?" question have
 * one answer instead of two — see [WalkthroughDialog].
 *
 * ── NOTHING HERE AWAITS A REQUEST ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * No repository, no coroutine scope, no suspend call, no `LaunchedEffect` that fetches. The steps are
 * a compiled-in `listOf`, the icons ship inside the APK, the flag is an XML file in this app's own
 * `shared_prefs/`, and the destination buttons hand a `NavDestination` to a router that is already in
 * memory. This has to be true rather than merely likely: the fortnight this walkthrough describes
 * happens in courtyards with no bar of signal, and an onboarding screen that spins on first launch is
 * an onboarding screen a new designer force-quits.
 * ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

/*
 * THE SAME SHARED-PREFERENCES FILE `MainActivity` ALREADY OWNS, NAMED AGAIN RATHER THAN IMPORTED.
 *
 * `MainActivity.kt` declares `APP_PREFS_NAME = "fieldrepo_prefs"` private to itself and keeps the
 * AI-cost acknowledgement in it. Moving that constant here to share it would drag two unrelated
 * helpers across a file boundary for no gain, so the literal is repeated — with this comment, which
 * is the whole price of repeating it.
 *
 * DO NOT "TIDY" THIS NAME. It is pre-rebrand and it stays pre-rebrand. `getSharedPreferences` with a
 * name no file has yet does not fail: it hands back an empty document. So renaming this string would
 * not migrate one stored flag, it would silently re-show the walkthrough to every installed user on
 * the update that renamed it. `AppPreferencesStore` and `TokenStore` carry the same warning over
 * their own file names, where the cost is a lost theme and a forced sign-out respectively.

/**
 * True once this device's user has finished, skipped or backed out of the walkthrough at least once.
 *
 * DEVICE-LOCAL, AND THAT IS THE INTENDED SCOPE RATHER THAN A SHORTCUT. Making it per-account would
 * mean a fifth value on the `/preferences/me` contract — `ApiModels`, `WorkshopRepository`,
 * `AppearanceScreen` and the backend — to remember something about a tour of THIS handset's menu.
 * The consequence is written down so nobody reports it as a bug: a designer who signs in on a second
 * phone is shown it again there, and signing out and back in on the same phone is not.
 *
 * Reading it is a synchronous parse of a two-key XML file, and that is what makes it safe to read
 * while deciding the first screen rather than a frame afterwards — see the call site in
 * `MainActivity.HomeScreen`.
 *
 * IT IS A FIRST TOUCH OF THAT FILE, NOT A FREE LOOKUP AT ONE ALREADY IN MEMORY, and an earlier draft
 * of this paragraph claimed the opposite. `fieldrepo_prefs` has exactly one other reader —
 * `aiCostReminderSuppressed`, which nothing calls until somebody presses "Refine transcript" — and
 * `AppPreferencesStore` is a DIFFERENT file (`field_repository_preferences`). So this call is what
 * opens `fieldrepo_prefs`, and `getBoolean` waits on the load. What makes that acceptable is not that
 * somebody else paid for it: it is that the file holds two booleans, and that the app already makes
 * exactly this trade one layer up, where `AppPreferencesStore.read()` is deliberately synchronous in
 * `onCreate` because deciding the theme asynchronously flashes a light app at somebody who chose
 * Dark. Do not "fix" this by moving it to a coroutine — that reintroduces the frame of dashboard the
 * `remember` initialiser was moved here to remove.

/**
 * Whether the page turn should move, reading BOTH switches that get a vote.
 *
 * ── THE APP'S OWN SWITCH, WHICH IS THE ESTABLISHED CONVENTION ────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * `LocalAppPreferences.current.reducedMotion` is read at ten sites already — the island bar, the
 * media carousel, the gallery floor, the sketch panels, the stage screen, the scanner. It is the
 * convention and this file follows it rather than inventing a second one. `AppNavigation` states the
 * rule it enforces: "Stops animations and transitions" is a promise the user made the app.
 *
 * ── THE DEVICE'S OWN SWITCH, WHICH THIS FILE IS THE FIRST TO READ ────────────────────────────────
 *
 * `Settings.Global.ANIMATOR_DURATION_SCALE` — Developer options › "Animator duration scale", and the
 * setting an accessibility service or a battery saver turns to zero on the user's behalf — is read by
 * NO other Kotlin in this application. Compose's own recomposer installs a `MotionDurationScale` from
 * it, so `AnimatedContent` does collapse when the platform says zero, and in practice the framework
 * has been carrying this for the whole app. But the Accessibility card on `AppearanceScreen` promises
 * in as many words that "Your device's own reduce-motion setting is always honoured too", and a
 * promise that rests entirely on a framework default is a promise nothing in this repository asserts.
 * So this one composable performs the OR explicitly, and I am writing down that I introduced it here:
 * it is a NEW convention in this codebase, it currently has exactly one caller, and if a second
 * screen wants it the right move is to lift this function to a shared place rather than to copy the
 * `Settings.Global` read. Copying it is how the two would drift.
 *
 * ── WHAT EACH SWITCH ACTUALLY PRODUCES, BECAUSE THE TWO ARE NOT THE SAME REQUEST ─────────────────
 *
 * True from either source sends [WalkthroughJourney] down its reduced-motion branch, which is not one
 * decision but nine: the travelling node stops being drawn, the reveal stops rising, the bubble stops
 * growing, the chevron and the detail panel `snap()`, and a programmatic scroll becomes a jump
 * because SMOOTH SCROLLING IS MOTION TOO. The one thing that does not become instant is the header's
 * active-step swap, which stays a 90 ms cross-fade and NOT a `snap()` — the app's settled position,
 * argued in `DwMediaCarousel`: reduced motion asks for no MOVEMENT, not for no change at all, and an
 * instant substitution of a line of text reads as a rendering glitch rather than as a change. When
 * the DEVICE is the one asking, that fade then collapses to nothing anyway without a line of code
 * here: Compose installs a `MotionDurationScale` from this very setting, so `tween(90)` resolves to
 * zero duration and the words swap instantly. So "the app's own switch" means no movement, and "the
 * platform says zero" means no transition at all, which is what each of them asked for.
 *
 * Read once per [Context] rather than on every recomposition: this is a `ContentResolver` round trip
 * to the settings provider, and a page-turn animation is not worth an IPC per frame. The cost of that
 * choice is that flipping the developer-options slider while this dialog is open does not take effect
 * until it is reopened, which is the correct trade for a surface a designer sees once.

/**
 * The walkthrough's window: a full-bleed dialog with [WalkthroughJourney] scrolling inside it.
 *
 * THE SIGNATURE IS UNCHANGED FROM THE PAGED VERSION, ON PURPOSE. `MainActivity` is seventeen thousand
 * lines long, other work landed in it today, and it holds six things that have to keep agreeing about
 * this dialog — the first-run gate inside a `remember` initialiser, the router arm, the `navigate`
 * exemption, the Settings row, the dashboard button and the `pendingUpdate == null` ordering guard
 * that keeps this from burying a required-update prompt. Replacing the entire surface behind an
 * identical two-lambda signature is what let all six of them stay exactly as they were, and that
 * ordering guard becomes MORE load-bearing now that this fills the screen rather than floating over
 * the middle of it: do not touch it, and do not give this composable a parameter that would make
 * somebody have to.
 *
 * ── ONE EXIT LAMBDA, ON PURPOSE ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * [onFinish] is called by Skip, by Done, by the system back gesture with nothing open, and by a
 * dismissal from outside. There is no second way out and no second lambda, because the requirement that
 * "Skip and Done must both clear the flag and land in the same place" is only enforceable if the two
 * are literally the same call. Two lambdas doing the same two things is exactly the shape in which
 * one of them later loses the `markWalkthroughSeen`, and the symptom — the walkthrough reappearing
 * tomorrow for somebody who dismissed it — does not show up until tomorrow.
 *
 * Where they land is not a routing decision at all: this dialog draws over whatever screen was
 * already there, so closing it reveals that screen. The dashboard on first run, the half-filled form
 * a designer re-opened it from otherwise. There is no destination to get wrong and no stack to
 * unwind, which is the same property that makes the system-back handling below safe.
 *
 * ── WHERE THE BACK GESTURE ACTUALLY GOES, ESTABLISHED RATHER THAN ASSUMED ────────────────────────
 *
 * Back has to return the reader where they came from and must never strand them on an empty stack.
 * Both halves hold here for structural reasons, and the second one is not obvious from reading this
 * file, so it is written down together with how it was checked.
 *
 * A `BackHandler` registers against `LocalOnBackPressedDispatcherOwner`, and inside a dialog that
 * owner is NOT the Activity. Compose's `DialogWrapper` extends `androidx.activity.ComponentDialog`,
 * which carries an `OnBackPressedDispatcher` of its own and, in `initializeViewTreeOwners`,
 * publishes itself on the dialog window's decor view; the composition local's fallback is exactly
 * that view-tree lookup. So the handler in [WalkthroughJourney] binds to THIS WINDOW's dispatcher.
 * That was read out of `compose-ui 1.7.8` and `activity 1.9.3` in the Gradle cache rather than
 * remembered — the two classes are `androidx.compose.ui.window.DialogWrapper` and
 * `androidx.activity.ComponentDialog`, and the line that matters is the
 * `ViewTreeOnBackPressedDispatcherOwner.set` on the decor view.
 *
 * Two consequences, and between them they are the whole answer. A back press inside the walkthrough
 * cannot reach `MainActivity`'s dispatcher, so it cannot run `goBack()` and cannot finish the
 * activity: there is no path from this surface to the launcher, whatever the journey's handler does.
 * And opening the walkthrough pushed nothing onto the app's own back stack, so there is nothing to
 * pop and "where the reader came from" is simply the screen that was never unmounted.
 *
 * ⚠ THAT IS A PROPERTY OF BEING A DIALOG, NOT OF THE HANDLER. Make this a `Screen` and the identical
 * `BackHandler` binds to the Activity instead, where it is one voice among several and where leaving
 * has to name a destination to leave to. `WalkthroughSurfaceTest` asserts that this stays a dialog,
 * for this reason as much as for the unsaved-changes one.
 *
 * ⚠ AND `dismissOnBackPress` MUST STAY FALSE, for a sharper reason than "two listeners". Setting it
 * true would not replace the journey's handler; `DialogWrapper` registers its callback on that same
 * dispatcher in its constructor, so there would be two enabled callbacks on one dispatcher and which
 * of them runs is a question about registration order that nothing in this file controls. With the
 * flag false that first callback is inert — its body is a test of this very property — and the
 * journey's, added later, is the one the dispatcher runs.
 *
 * ── WHY THE DESTINATION BUTTON IS NEVER HIDDEN ───────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * `visibleNavItems` hides a menu row the account cannot use — hidden, never disabled — and this
 * surface deliberately does the opposite. The walkthrough's own nav entry is ungated for the stated
 * reason that it must reach people who have earned no capability yet, several steps describe screens
 * that need Designer access, and each of those steps ENDS by saying that without it the screen will
 * tell you designer access is required. Hiding the button would make that sentence false and would
 * hide the existence of a capability from the one person who most needs to know it exists in order to
 * go and ask for it.
 *
 * WHAT IS ON THE FAR SIDE OF THAT BUTTON IS NOT UNIFORM, AND THE STEPS HAVE TO SAY SO RATHER THAN
 * THIS COMMENT ASSUMING IT. An earlier draft of this paragraph claimed "the screens themselves
 * re-derive their own predicate before they issue a request, so the refusal is drawn by the screen
 * that owns it", and that is true of exactly one of them. [DesignReviewScreen] opens with
 * `if (user == null || !FieldPermissions.canRunDesignWorkshops(user))` and draws "Designer access
 * required" before it asks the repository anything. [SketchesAndPrototypesScreen] takes no `UserDto`
 * at all — `repository`, `onOpenStage`, `onError` and nothing else — so it structurally cannot
 * refuse anybody: it asks for the workshop list and renders the failure, which means a 403 reads as
 * "The repository could not list your design workshops" and, with no signal, as the network's fault.
 * A walkthrough that promised a refusal there would be teaching a sentence the app cannot say, so
 * that step says what actually happens instead. Whoever gives that screen a tier refusal should go
 * and shorten the step; until then the step is the only place a non-designer is told.
 *
 * @param onFinish close the walkthrough and mark it seen. The caller owns both halves.
 * @param onOpen leave for [WalkStep.destination]. The caller must close and mark seen too, and must
 *   route through `MainActivity.navigate` rather than `openDestination`: the walkthrough itself is
 *   exempt from the unsaved-changes guard because it draws over the page you were on, but a screen it
 *   launches is a real departure from a possibly half-filled form and must still be asked about.
