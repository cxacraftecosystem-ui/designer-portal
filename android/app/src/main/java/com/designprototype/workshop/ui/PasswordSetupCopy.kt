/**
 * THE WORDS AND THE RULES BEHIND THE TWO PASSWORD SCREENS, with no Compose in sight.
 *
 * ── WHY THIS IS A FILE OF ITS OWN ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * The same argument `AccessRefusalCopy.kt` makes, and it applies harder here. Six of the sentences
 * below are one-per-refusal, each naming a DIFFERENT next action — "ask for another", "you already
 * used it, go and sign in", "ask the administrator what happened" — and the failure this feature can
 * actually ship is two of them being the same sentence, or one of them quietly becoming "invalid
 * link", which leaves a person with no next move at all. A `when` block inside a composable is not
 * reachable from a JVM test; this file is, and `PasswordSetupCopyTest` walks it.
 *
 * The token extraction is here for the same reason: it is the one piece of parsing on the redeem
 * path, it decides whether a designer who pastes a whole link gets a form or a refusal, and looking
 * at it is not evidence that it works.
 *
 * ── WHAT IS DELIBERATELY *NOT* HERE ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * The refusal sentence for a POST. `POST /auth/set-password` answers with the SERVER's own sentence
 * for every one of these reasons (`_SET_PASSWORD_REFUSALS` in backend/app/api/routes/auth.py), and
 * the redeem screen shows that verbatim rather than looking one up here. [passwordLinkRefusal] is
 * only for the link CHECK — `POST /auth/set-password/check`, or `GET /auth/set-password` on a server
 * older than that route — which answers with a reason WORD and no sentence, deliberately, because the
 * words a person reads are the client layer's job on that route and the server says so.
 */

 * `UserCreate.password` all carry 8 on the server, so that a password which can be SET can always be
 * used to sign in. The web mirrors it in `frontend/lib/signIn.ts`; this is the handset's copy.
 *
 * MIRRORED RATHER THAN FETCHED, the treatment `DW_DICTATION_MAX_BYTES` gets: no endpoint reports it,

 * used to report every failure the same way, so somebody whose new password was already in force was
 * told nothing had changed — and the retry, sent with the session the change had retired, came back
 * "This session is no longer valid". They signed out, typed the temporary password they had been
 * told was still theirs, were refused, and concluded they were locked out.
 *
 * So where the failure settles nothing ([changePasswordOutcomeKnown]), [probe] — `GET /me` with the
 * session this handset still holds — is asked first, and its answer chooses the sentence:
 *
 *  * **A plain 401:** the held session is dead, most likely retired by this very change. Sign out with
 *    [PASSWORD_MAY_ALREADY_BE_IN_EFFECT].
 *  * **The account still owes a password** (the flag, or the gate's own 401): nothing landed, so the
 *    gate's usual words are now true, and they are what it says.
 *  * **It owes none:** the server no longer asks for a change — a server older than the fingerprint
 *    kept the session and cleared the flag in the same write — so the gate is satisfied.
 *  * **No answer, or any other:** nothing is known. Stay, and say [PASSWORD_CHANGE_UNCONFIRMED].
 *
 * The failure's body is read once, and only on the arms that show its words. A cancelled coroutine is
 * not a failure and is rethrown: a screen that has left must not decide anything.

 * The token inside whatever a designer pasted.
 *
 * ── WHY THE SCREEN TAKES A PASTE AT ALL, RATHER THAN ONLY A DEEP LINK ────────────────────────────
 *
 * An administrator issues a link and hands it over by hand — a message, a note, read out over a
 * telephone. On a handset that arrives as a URL in a chat app, and tapping it opens a BROWSER, which
 * works and is not what somebody standing in a courtyard with this app open is trying to do. So the
 * screen accepts the whole link pasted, and also the bare token for the case where it reached them
 * without the address around it.
 *
 * ── THE TOKEN IS IN THE QUERY OR IN THE FRAGMENT, AND BOTH ARE READ ──────────────────────────────
 *
 * Links issued until now carry it in the query, `/set-password?token=…`. The server is moving them to
 * the FRAGMENT, `/set-password#token=…`, because a fragment is never sent to any server: the query
 * puts the token in the web host's request log and in the browser's history the moment the link is
 * opened (docs/OPEN_FINDINGS.md). The handset must read both — links of the old shape stay in chat
 * histories until they expire, and builds up to 0.0.15, which read only the query, are why the
 * server cannot switch until they have left the field. A tapped link reaches here whole, fragment
 * included: `MainActivity.takePasswordLink` hands over `Uri.toString()`, and the manifest's filter
 * matches on the path, which a fragment does not change.
 *
 * ── WHAT IT WILL AND WILL NOT DO ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * It reads `token=` where it opens a parameter of the query or of the fragment — after `?`, `&` or
 * `#` — and otherwise returns the text as typed. The first one found wins; a link never carries two.
 * It does NOT validate the shape: the token is `base64url(payload).base64url(HMAC)` and the server
 * checks the signature, the shape, the expiry, the row AND the credential fingerprint. A client-side
 * shape test would only be able to produce a SEVENTH refusal — one the server does not have a word
 * for — for a string the server might well have accepted.
 *
 * PERCENT-DECODING IS DONE HERE because the value is URL-encoded in the link, and what the server
 * verifies is the token itself: sent in the check's JSON body, or — to a server older than that
 * route — in a query string Retrofit encodes again. Either way the encoded form would put `%3D` in
 * the token and the signature would not verify. It is deliberately NOT a general decoder — only
 * `%XX` pairs, and a malformed one is left standing rather than throwing, because a person who
 * pasted something odd is owed the server's refusal and not a crash.
