/**
 * **THE WALKTHROUGH'S SURFACE AND ITS WIRING** — one window, one exit, and the flag that exit writes.
 *
 * ── WHY THIS FILE EXISTS ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * `WalkthroughStepsTest` holds the step list to the web's. Nothing held the six things around it,
 * and they are the half that silently breaks, because each one is a single line living in a file
 * that is seventeen thousand lines long and that four other pieces of work land in on any given day.
 * The list of them is short and every entry is a defect somebody has already shipped, here or
 * elsewhere:
 *
 *  1. **A skip that does not write the flag.** The walkthrough closes, the designer gets on with
 *     their morning, and it opens again over their dashboard tomorrow. It looks completely correct
 *     in review and in a manual pass; it is only wrong on the SECOND launch, which nobody does while
 *     testing the change that broke it.
 *  2. **A second exit.** The moment there are two lambdas that both close the walkthrough, one of
 *     them is the one that later loses its `markWalkthroughSeen`. Defect 1 is not prevented by
 *     remembering to write the flag twice; it is prevented by there being one place that writes it.
 *  3. **The flag read one frame late.** Read in a `LaunchedEffect` rather than in the `remember`
 *     initialiser, the dashboard paints on its own and the walkthrough lands on top of it a frame
 *     later — a visible flash of the real screen, shown to the exact person who has seen neither.
 *  4. **The walkthrough burying a required update.** The update prompt is deliberately
 *     non-dismissable; a full-screen walkthrough drawn over it is an app that cannot be used and
 *     cannot be updated, and the only way out is to clear the app's data.
 *  5. **A door quietly closing.** The menu chip and the Settings row are how anybody reads this a
 *     second time. Losing one is invisible — the other still works, so the feature still "works".
 *  6. **The menu chip acquiring a gate.** The entry is ungated on purpose: a crowdsource volunteer
 *     on day one, who has earned no capability at all, needs the walkthrough more than an admin
 *     does. A `can` predicate added here in the ordinary course of tidying the nav table would hide
 *     it from precisely the account it was written for.
 *
 * ── WHY IT READS SOURCE ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * Because none of the six can be imported. `showWalkthrough`, `finishWalkthrough`, the router arm,
 * the `navigate` exemption and the ordering guard are all locals inside one composable in
 * `MainActivity.kt`; the window's own properties and the prefs strings are private to
 * `WalkthroughScreen.kt`; Skip, Done and the back handler are inside composables, and there is no
 * Robolectric in this module, so a rule written inside a composable is a rule nothing can exercise.
 * That is the same reasoning, the same helpers and the same trade `DashboardTileParityTest` makes
 * against the dashboard grid, and `DesignWorkshopCardTest` and `DwWorkshopSearchRegistryTest` against
 * their own registers. Source is also the stronger instrument for what is being defended against
 * here, which is somebody EDITING one of these lines: a deleted door or a moved flag write fails
 * below BY NAME, and none of the six has a type, a lint or a compiler with an opinion about it.
 *
 * What CAN be imported is imported — the step list and the nav table are both `internal` and this
 * test source set is the same module, so the two assertions that can be made against real values
 * rather than against text are made that way.
 *
 * COMMENTS ARE STRIPPED FIRST, and that is not housekeeping. These three files are more prose than
 * code, and every sentence this test looks for is also DISCUSSED at length somewhere above the line
 * that implements it — `markWalkthroughSeen` is named in four comments and called once. An assertion
 * that the flag is written must not be satisfiable by a paragraph about writing the flag, and, worse,
 * a count of call sites would come back four times too high and would be green for the wrong reason.
 *
 * [stripComments] is a copy of the one in `DashboardTileParityTest`, which pins both halves of its
 * behaviour in a test of its own; it is copied rather than shared because it is private to that file
 * and lifting it would put a test helper in the production tree. It nests, because Kotlin block
 * comments nest and this file's whole job is to read Kotlin the way the compiler does.
 *
 * ⚠ NEITHER A BLOCK-COMMENT OPENER NOR A CLOSER IS TYPED ANYWHERE IN THIS KDOC, and that is a rule
 * rather than a preference. Kotlin nests them, so an opener written inside a comment — a glob, a
 * mime wildcard, a regex quoted in prose — opens a SECOND comment that this block's own closer then
 * closes instead of ending the block, and everything from here to the next closer in the file stops
 * being code. The failure is a compile error a long way from the sentence that caused it, and it
 * takes the whole unit-test source set with it, because Kotlin compiles it as one unit. That has
 * already happened once in this tree, to `DashboardTileParityTest`, whose own KDoc records it.
 * Name the characters in words, as this paragraph does.
