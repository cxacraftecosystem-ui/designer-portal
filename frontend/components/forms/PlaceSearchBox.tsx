/**
 * Type a village, move the map. The one affordance that makes a map picker usable in rural India.
 *
 * A SEARCH RESULT MOVES THE CAMERA AND WRITES NOTHING. This is the load-bearing rule, it is not a
 * detail of this component, and it is why `onChoose` hands back a `PlaceHit` — a point and an extent
 * — rather than an address: there is nothing here a record could be filled in from. The coordinate
 * that reaches a research record is still the one the designer places by hand afterwards, and the
 * state and district still come from the reverse path, through the closed lists in
 * `backend/app/services/address.py`. `LocationFields` says it in one line and it holds here too: the
 * geocoder may offer a value; a person accepts it.
 *
 * WHY IT STOPS `input` AND `keydown` FROM LEAVING IT. Every record form in this repo is
 * `<form onInput={() => setDirty(true)} onKeyDown={handleFormEnter}>`, and this is a real text box
 * sitting inside one. Without the firewall, merely typing "Barpali" to LOOK at the map would arm the
 * unsaved-changes prompt on a form nobody has edited — so a designer who searched, moved the map,
 * placed nothing and pressed Back would be accused of losing work they never did. Enter is the same
 * bug with a worse ending: `handleFormEnter` would walk focus to the next field, or submit the
 * record, instead of choosing the place under the cursor. `WorkshopSelect` carries the identical
 * firewall for the identical reason.
 *
 * IT DOES NOT TRAP FOCUS, on purpose, matching `SearchableSelect` and `AnchoredPopover`: Tab leaves,
 * Escape dismisses, and a picker that swallows the keyboard is worse than no picker.
