 * THE RULE AND THE PARSER BOTH MOVED OUT OF THIS FILE, AND THE MOVE IS THE WHOLE POINT.
 *
 * They were `parsePhone` and an inline ternary in the body below — private, unexported, and
 * therefore enforced on the record page and NOWHERE ELSE. The design workshop mounts this very
 * component for `participant.phone` with `mirror={false}`, which drops the native `pattern` and
 * leaves the message advisory, and `coerce_value` had no phone rule at all on either path. So a
 * nine-digit number typed into a stage saved cleanly and printed in a ministry roster.
 *
 * `FieldSpec.text_format = PHONE_IN` now declares the rule on the field and the server enforces it,
 * with `lib/textFormats` as the one implementation all three sides read. This component keeps the
 * inline message it always had — same function, so it cannot disagree with the refusal.

 * Phone input with an ISD-prefix picker (flag emoji + dial code, default +91). Submits ONE string

 * FormData handlers and API payload are unchanged. +91 requires exactly 10 digits; any other code
 * 4-14 digits (both blocked natively via the mirror's pattern AND surfaced as an inline error).
 * Switching away from +91 asks for confirmation — it marks the artisan as a foreign resident.
 *
 * ALSO MOUNTED BY THE DESIGN WORKSHOP, on every registry field the registry typed `PHONE`
 * (`participant.phone`, `surveyResponse.contact`). That is why the two props below exist and why
 * neither has a default that changes anything for the record forms:
 *
 * - `disabled` — a stage that has been submitted is read-only, and a control with no way to say so
 *   is a control a designer can edit after the report has gone to the ministry.
 * - `mirror` — a stage form is not a `<form>` and reads nothing from FormData, so the zero-size
 *   mirror there would contribute a stray `name="phone"` and a `pattern` to any form a later change
 *   happened to wrap the page in. Native constraint validation is deliberately absent from the
 *   workshop (see `FieldInput`'s DATE branch on why `required` is never passed): completeness is
 *   judged by `stage_completeness` when a report is generated, not by the browser at save time.
 *
 * The handset makes the same choice and states it: `FieldRenderer.kt` gives `DwFieldType.PHONE` its
 * own arm and calls `ArtisanPhoneField`, the record form's control reused whole, "because the
 * alternative is a second phone field without the measured dial column, the country search and the
 * foreign-resident confirmation this one already carries."

   *
   * This control renders `digits` — what `splitStoredPhone` could parse — and composes `combined`
   * from it. A stored value with no digits in it therefore drew AN EMPTY BOX: `combined` was "",
   * `phoneValidationError("")` was null, and the design workshop's wrapper stays deliberately quiet
   * for a PHONE field (`formatShownByControl`) because this control is supposed to be the one saying
   * it. So `participant.phone` holding "not a number" — copied there by `hydrate_entries` from a
   * column nothing has ever validated — was refused by the server on every save, restored from
   * `previous`, and reported by nobody: the value snapped back on the next GET with no red text
   * anywhere and an empty box where the fault was.
   *
   * A value that IS number-shaped needs none of this: its digits are in the box, so a wrong count is
   * something the designer can see and fix. What this names is the case where the box and the column
   * hold different things.
   *
   * PRINTED VERBATIM, because "there is something here you cannot see" is not actionable and the
   * string itself is: it is usually a note somebody typed into a phone column ("ask his son"), which
   * tells the designer where the number actually is.

  /**
   * THE NAME IS ON THE ROW AND IT IS WHAT THE FILTER BOX SEARCHES.

   * ── WHAT THIS FIXED ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
   * The label used to be the flag and the dial code and nothing else, while `lib/countries.ts`
   * carries `name` for all ~246 rows. This is the longest list in the application, so it is well
   * past `SEARCH_THRESHOLD` and DID get a filter box — over text that contained no country name. So
   * typing "india", "uruguay" or "nepal" into the country picker answered "No matches", and the only
   * thing that matched was the dial code, which the reader is opening this control to look up. Dial
   * codes are not unique either: "+1" is shared by the United States and Canada and prefixes about
   * twenty more territories, so a dozen rows read identically apart from an emoji nobody can search.
   * `RENDER_CAP` compounds it — 80 of 246 rows are drawn, so scrolling does not reach the rest and
   * the notice says "keep typing", which was the one thing that did not work.
   *
   * ── WHY THE NAME IS THE `hint` AND NOT THE `label`, WHICH IS THE OTHER WAY ROUND FROM ANDROID ───
   * `SearchableSelect` renders the option's LABEL in the closed trigger, and this trigger is a 9rem
   * column beside the number box — the dial code is the whole of what it has room to say, and the
   * dial code is what the composed value `+91 9876543210` is built from. Android does not have that
   * constraint: `PhoneField.kt` keeps a separate read-only "Code" box always showing the prefix, so
   * its rows are free to lead with the name (`SelectOption(value = dialCode, label = it.name, hint =
   * it.dialCode)`). Same two columns on both clients, same searchability on both clients, opposite
   * order — because on one of them the row's first column is also the collapsed control's only text.
   * Stated here rather than left to look like a divergence nobody noticed.
