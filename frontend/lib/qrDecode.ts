/**
 * Reading a QR symbol out of a photograph, in this browser, from nothing but this file.
 *
 * ── WHY THIS EXISTS AT ALL, AND WHY THE ARGUMENT AGAINST IT NO LONGER HOLDS ──────────────────
 *
 * `components/designworkshop/WorkshopCodeScanner.tsx` used to refuse to bundle a decoder, in
 * writing, and the refusal was reasoned: "every JavaScript QR decoder worth shipping is tens of
 * kilobytes of image processing that would sit in the bundle of every device — including the ones
 * that have the native detector — to serve the browser share that does not."
 *
 * THAT ARGUMENT WAS BUILT ON A MEASUREMENT THAT WAS NEVER TAKEN, and when it was taken it said the
 * opposite. `lib/identityCardLocal.ts` records the probe, run on this machine on 2026-08-09:
 *
 * | browser                                                  | `BarcodeDetector` |
 * |----------------------------------------------------------|-------------------|
 * | Chrome 151, headed                                        | **absent**        |
 * | Chrome 151, headed, `--enable-experimental-web-platform-features` | **absent** |
 * | Edge 151, headed and headless                             | **absent**        |
 * | Chromium 151 (Playwright), incl. `--enable-blink-features=ShapeDetection` | **absent** |
 *
 * Chrome's own documentation says barcode detection ships "on macOS, ChromeOS, and Android". The
 * machines this web client is actually used on are Windows laptops in a district office. So "the
 * browser share that does not have it" was not a minority to be traded away — on this surface it
 * was EVERYBODY, and the cost of the missing decoder was not a slower path but the total absence of
 * both camera scanning and photograph upload, on every laptop, every time.
 *
 * ── WHY UPLOAD IS THE PATH THAT MATTERS, NOT A NICETY ────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * A camera scan needs a working camera, a granted permission, enough light, and a second device in
 * the room holding the code up. An upload needs a file: a screenshot, a photograph taken in the
 * morning before the artisan went home, a WhatsApp forward, a printed sheet photographed last week,
 * a laptop with no camera at all. In this application's field conditions the upload is frequently
 * the only route that exists, which is why {@link decodeQrFromGrey} is built for a PHOTOGRAPH OF A
 * SCREEN — skewed, glared, and holding a code that is a small part of a large picture — rather than
 * for the clean synthetic images a decoder is easy to pass on.
 *
 * ── WHY IT IS HAND-WRITTEN, THE SAME ARGUMENT `qrEncode.ts` MAKES ────────────────────────────
 *
 * `frontend/package.json` carries no QR library, and the encoder next door is hand-written for
 * reasons that apply here word for word: ISO 18004 was frozen in 2000 and will not change again,
 * the symbols must still read in 2030, and a dependency brings a transitive tree, its future CVEs
 * and its future breaking major under a feature whose whole specification is stable. What is new is
 * that this half costs far less to own than it looks, because almost none of it is new code:
 *
 *  - **The bit-level tables and every placement rule come from `lib/qrEncode.ts`** — the same block
 *    layout, the same zigzag, the same mask formulae, the same GF(256) tables, the same
 *    format-information generator. Nothing is transcribed a second time. See that file's header for
 *    why this is a correctness property and not a convenience: a decoder with its own copy of the
 *    tables reads a card as a DIFFERENT identifier rather than failing, and the check digit agrees
 *    all the way because both halves computed it over the same wrong bytes.
 *  - **The image-level work comes from `lib/sketchRectify.ts` and `lib/photoMeasure.ts`** — Sauvola
 *    local thresholding, the projective solve, and bilinear sampling, all already in this
 *    repository, already justified at length, and already under test. The glare on a photographed
 *    screen is the same problem as the lamp gradient on a photographed sketch, and it has the same
 *    answer; a photographed card at an angle is the same problem as a photographed sheet at an
 *    angle, and it has the same answer.
 *
 * So what is genuinely new here is the DETECTOR — finding the three finder patterns and the
 * alignment pattern in a photograph — and the Reed-Solomon ERROR CORRECTION, which is the half of
 * the code the encoder never needed.
 *
 * ── VERSIONS 1 TO 6, AND WHY THE CEILING IS A REFUSAL RATHER THAN A GAP ──────────────────────
 *
 * This reads exactly the versions `qrEncode.ts` writes, because it reads that file's own tables.
 * A larger symbol — someone's payment QR, a shipping label — is DETECTED and then refused by name:
 * "this is a QR code, but not one this app printed". That is the honest answer and it is a more
 * useful one than a decode would be, because a payment QR resolving to nothing is exactly as
 * unhelpful as a payment QR not being read.
 *
 * Raising the ceiling means adding the alignment centres and the block table for versions 7 and up
 * to `qrEncode.ts` — 34 more rows of ISO 18004 table 9, transcribed by hand. Do not do it to "be
 * general": every row is a chance to make a card read as the wrong record, and the existing rows
 * are the ones `e2e/workshop-codes.spec.ts` verifies against reportlab.
 *
 * PURE — no React, no fetch, no DOM, no clock, no randomness — in the sense `lib/marketAnalysis.ts`
 * is, and for the same reason: it has to run on a laptop that has had no signal for three days, and
 * be testable without one. The browser glue (a File, a bitmap, a video frame) lives in
 * `lib/qrImageDecode.ts`, so everything below can be driven from a plain array of numbers.

 * pristine symbols, which is to say it reads them on a developer's screen and not in a courtyard.
 *
 * `received` is the block as read: `data` codewords followed by `ec` codewords, highest-order
 * first. It is corrected in place. The return value is the number of errors repaired, or -1 when
 * the block is beyond repair — which is a genuine and expected answer (a symbol sampled off a
 * grid that was one module out produces garbage in every block), and is why the caller must never
 * treat a corrected block as merely "probably right".
 *

/**
 * Turn a greyscale photograph into black and white, for a QR symbol specifically.
 *
 * ── WHY THIS IS NOT `sketchRectify.sauvolaThreshold`, WHICH IS RIGHT NEXT DOOR ───────────────
 *
 * It was, first, and it failed in a way worth recording because the reasoning that led to it is
 * sound and still leads there. Sauvola is the repository's local threshold, it is proved against a
 * lamp gradient in `e2e/sketch-rectify.spec.ts`, and glare on a screen is a lighting problem of
 * exactly that family. But Sauvola's window is sized for a SKETCH — a fraction of the short edge —
 * and it thresholds each pixel against the MEAN and standard deviation of that window. Both
 * assumptions come from the same place: a page of line art is overwhelmingly blank paper, so a
 * window is mostly paper and its mean is the paper's brightness.
 *
 * A QR symbol breaks both. Its dark modules are half its area, so the "paper" mean does not exist;
 * and, fatally, a window can lie ENTIRELY INSIDE ONE DARK MODULE. When it does, the local mean is
 * the dark value itself, the standard deviation is nearly zero, Sauvola's threshold collapses to
 * `m·(1 − k)` — a shade BELOW the very pixels it is judging — and the whole module is classified as
 * light. That is not a subtle loss of quality: the 3×3 core of every finder pattern is the largest
 * solid dark area in the symbol, so it is the first thing to be erased, and the detector then finds
 * no symbol at all in a photograph a person can read at a glance.
 *
 * It is also counter-intuitive in a way that cost real time here: the failure gets WORSE as the
 * photograph gets BETTER. A code filling the frame has modules twenty pixels across and windows
 * comfortably inside them; a code in the corner of a large photograph has modules of four pixels
 * and every window spans several. The first symbols to fail were the clean, close, well-framed
 * ones.
 *
 * ── WHAT THIS DOES INSTEAD ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * A local MIDRANGE — the midpoint between the darkest and lightest pixel of a neighbourhood —
 * computed on a grid of 8-pixel blocks and smoothed across each block's neighbours. Min and max do
 * not care what proportion of the window is dark, which is the whole point, and a block that is
 * genuinely uniform is detected by its tiny dynamic range and given its NEIGHBOURS' threshold
 * instead of a meaningless one of its own. That single rule is what lets a window inside a dark
 * module still come out dark.
 *
 * This is the classic hybrid binarizer, and it is here rather than imported for the reason the rest
 * of this file is: it is thirty lines of arithmetic against a stable specification, and the
 * alternative was a dependency.
 *
 * Output matches the repository's convention and `sauvolaThreshold`'s: 0 is dark, 255 is light.

 * The module size along the line joining two finder patterns.
 *
 * ── WHY THIS IS DIRECTIONAL, AND WHY AVERAGING THE TWO DIRECTIONS IS EXACT ───────────────────
 *
 * A photograph of a card held at an angle compresses the symbol along one axis. Measure the module
 * from a HORIZONTAL scan line and you learn the module size across the top edge; use that same
 * number down the vertical edge, which is 27% shorter, and the symbol is measured as having a
 * quarter fewer rows than it has. That is not a small error — the version comes out wrong, the grid
 * is the wrong size, and every codeword after the first is read from the wrong place. It is the
 * defect that failed the two skewed cases in `e2e/qr-decode-unit.spec.ts` while every flat one
 * passed, which is a diagnostic worth remembering: on this pipeline a *better* photograph, taken
 * closer and squarer, fails differently from a worse one.
 *
 * The fix is to measure along each edge and average the two, and the averaging is EXACT rather than
 * a tolerable approximation. Writing m₁ and m₂ for the module sizes along the two edges and n for
 * the true number of modules between the finder centres, the two estimates against the averaged
 * module size are 2n·m₁/(m₁+m₂) and 2n·m₂/(m₁+m₂); their mean is n, for any m₁ and m₂ whatever. The
 * anisotropy cancels algebraically, which is why this holds for a steeply angled photograph and not
 * merely for a slightly tilted one.
 *
 * `fallback` is the module size the detector estimated from the scan that found the pattern, used
 * when the run walks off the edge of the picture — a symbol against the frame edge is still worth
 * trying to read.

/**
 * Hunt for the alignment pattern near where the geometry says it should be.
 *
 * WHY IT IS WORTH HUNTING FOR. Three points determine an affine map — a map with no perspective in
 * it at all — and an affine map is exactly right only for a symbol photographed square-on. A card
 * held at an angle, or a code on a screen photographed from a chair, is a projective view: parallel
 * edges converge, and an affine grid laid over it drifts progressively across the symbol until, a
 * module or two out at the far corner, every sampled bit past the middle is wrong. The alignment
 * pattern is the fourth point that pins that corner down, and it is the difference between reading
 * a photograph and reading a scan.
 *
 * Returns null when it is not found, which is not a failure — the caller falls back to the affine
 * estimate, which is correct for a flat photograph and is what version 1 symbols always use because
 * they carry no alignment pattern at all.
 *
 * ── THE WINNER IS THE MOST-CONFIRMED CANDIDATE, NOT THE NEAREST ONE ──────────────────────────
 *
 * This used to keep whichever match landed closest to `estimate`, and that is the wrong question to
 * ask, for a reason that is easy to miss: `estimate` is the PARALLELOGRAM guess, and the whole
 * reason this function is being called is that the parallelogram guess is wrong under perspective.
 * Ranking by distance to it therefore ranks by agreement with the very error being corrected — and
 * on a steeply angled card the true pattern loses to a lucky data module by several modules.
 *
 * The honest discriminator is the one {@link orderFinders} already uses on finder patterns: one
 * crossing is a coincidence, several is a structure. A real 5x5 alignment pattern is crossed by
 * roughly `moduleSize` scan rows through its centre module, and every one of them produces the same
 * triple and the same vertical confirmation; a data module that happens to look like a light ring
 * satisfies it on one row by luck and not on its neighbours. So the hits are CLUSTERED and COUNTED,
 * exactly as {@link recordCandidate} does, and the cluster with the most members wins. Distance to
 * the estimate is kept only as the tie-break between equally-confirmed clusters, where it is a fair
 * question again.
 *
 * Clustering pays a second time: averaging a cluster's members is worth a few tenths of a pixel at
 * the corner the whole homography is pinned by, and the grid is projected across the symbol from it.

 * The x of every alignment-pattern centre this row could be crossing.
 *
 * ── THE RUN PATTERN MATCHED IS LIGHT-DARK-LIGHT, AND THE PARITY IS THE WHOLE POINT ───────────
 *
 * A row through the middle of a 5x5 alignment pattern reads
 *
 *     [ … data … ] [ring D] [ring L] [centre D] [ring L] [ring D] [ … data … ]
 *
 * and the obvious thing to match is the DARK-LIGHT-DARK in the middle of that, one module each.
 * This did exactly that, and it was wrong in a way no amount of tolerance-tuning fixes: the two
 * dark ring runs are NOT one module wide in general, because the ring is one module of dark with
 * arbitrary DATA beyond it, and a dark data module against the ring fuses with it into a run two or
 * three modules long. The pattern was then rejected on every row — measured, on the mirrored case
 * in `e2e/qr-decode-unit.spec.ts`: runs of 15px, 8px, 7px against a 7.6px module, refused because
 * the leading run was two modules of fused dark rather than one.
 *
 * The light runs have no such freedom. Each is bounded by the dark ring on one side and the dark
 * centre on the other, both of which are part of the pattern — so a LIGHT-DARK-LIGHT triple of one
 * module each is invariant no matter what the surrounding data does, and the dark run in the middle
 * of it IS the centre module, with no ambiguity about which of two dark runs was matched. (The
 * D-L-D form had that ambiguity too: it matches once with the centre in the middle and again with
 * the centre as its leading run, and the second match returns the ring's x, not the centre's.)
 *
 * Dark is still required immediately beyond both light runs — that is the ring, and requiring it is
 * what keeps this from matching an isolated dark module sitting in blank space.
 *
 * EVERY RUN IS MEASURED AGAINST THE MODULE SIZE THE DETECTOR ALREADY KNOWS, never against the
 * triple's own mean. {@link isFinderRatio} may normalise against `total / 7` because a finder's
 * 1:1:3:1:1 is a SHAPE — the long middle run pins the scale. An alignment pattern's 1:1:1 is
 * scale-FREE: three consecutive runs of any equal length satisfy it, so a self-normalised test asks
 * only "are these three runs similar to each other", which the symbol's data area answers yes to
 * constantly. It did not even ask that strictly — with the mean free to float, a 1:2:1 triple
 * (`counts` of [10, 21, 10] against a 9.4px module) passed, because the mean drifted up to 13.7 and
 * every run then sat inside a tolerance computed from the drifted mean.
 *
 * Half a module of tolerance, matching {@link isFinderRatio}. It cannot be tighter: the runs are
 * measured in whole pixels off a photograph, and at the far corner of a steeply angled card the

 *
 * 1. **Sauvola local thresholding** (`lib/sketchRectify.ts`). Not a global threshold, and the
 *    reason is the whole reason this decoder can read a photograph of a screen: a screen
 *    photographed at an angle has a specular highlight across part of it, and a monitor's own
 *    brightness falls off toward its edges. There is no single grey level that separates dark
 *    modules from light ones across a glare — any level dark enough to see modules inside the
 *    highlight reads half the unglared symbol as dark. A local threshold compares every pixel with
 *    the paper immediately around it, so the highlight cancels instead of being fought. That
 *    function's own header proves the point on a lamp gradient, in the test suite.
 * 2. **Finder detection**, twice confirmed, on both axes. See {@link crossCheck}.
 * 3. **Alignment pattern**, for the perspective a card held at an angle really has. See
 *    {@link findAlignment}.
 * 4. **Projective sampling** through `photoMeasure.solveHomography` — the same hand-written direct
 *    linear transform the measuring feature uses, already proved in `e2e/photo-measure.spec.ts`
 *    against a fifth point that took no part in the fit.
 * 5. **{@link decodeQrMatrix}**, and if that fails at the format strip, the same grid TRANSPOSED.
 *    A transpose is a mirror about the diagonal, which is what a photograph taken with a front
 *    camera in mirror mode, or of a reflection in a window, actually is. It costs one retry and it
 *    turns a class of "unreadable" into a read.
 *
 * The failure carries a {@link QrRegion} whenever the symbol was FOUND but not READ, which is what
 * lets `lib/qrImageDecode.ts` cut that region out of the full-resolution original and try again —
