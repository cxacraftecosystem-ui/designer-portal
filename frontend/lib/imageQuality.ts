/**
 * On-device photograph quality checks — blur, resolution, duplicates and missing views.
 *
 * WHY THIS RUNS ON THE HANDSET, AND WHY IT RUNS AT SELECTION
 *
 * A designer photographs a product in a village that is a couple of hundred kilometres from the
 * next reliable connection, and the upload happens hours or days later. A check that runs on the
 * server therefore reports "that photograph is out of focus" to somebody sitting at a desk, about an
 * object that has since been sold, in a cluster nobody is going back to this month. The finding is
 * true and completely useless. The only moment the warning is worth anything is the moment the
 * designer is still standing in front of the object and can simply take the picture again — which
 * is the instant the file is CHOSEN, before it joins the upload queue. Everything below is
 * arithmetic on pixels the browser has already decoded; nothing here touches the network.
 *
 * THESE CHECKS ARE READ-ONLY ON THE PIXELS, AND THAT IS A HARD RULE
 *
 * docs/MEDIA_PIPELINE.md §5 records a deliberate refusal to re-encode images: this is a heritage
 * archive, the original file IS the artifact, and a canvas round-trip destroys full resolution and
 * strips the EXIF the app preserves on purpose (`collectExifMetadata`, and the on-screen promise
 * that "captured files go up unchanged"). So this module MEASURES and never modifies. It decodes to
 * a scratch bitmap, reads numbers off it, closes it, and leaves the `File` byte-for-byte untouched.
 * There is no `toBlob`, no `toDataURL`, no re-compression and no write path anywhere in this file,
 * and there must never be one — a "helpful" downscale here would quietly become the thing the
 * pipeline document exists to forbid.
 *
 * A FINDING IS ADVICE, NEVER A REFUSAL
 *
 * Every function here returns descriptions. None of them can stop an upload, delete a file or swap
 * one out, and the surfacing must keep it that way. A designer may have deliberately photographed
 * something blurred (a loom in motion), or may be holding the ONLY photograph that will ever exist
 * of an object that is about to leave. Blocking that is a worse failure than every problem this
 * module can detect, put together.
 *
 * THE SHAPE OF THIS FILE: A PURE CORE, THEN A THIN BROWSER ADAPTER
 *
 * Everything above {@link measureImageFile} is plain arithmetic over a greyscale plane — no DOM, no
 * `File`, no network — so it can be unit-tested directly against images the test GENERATES, and so
 * the measurement can be ported to Kotlin for Android parity without carrying any of the web's
 * decoding machinery with it. Only the adapter below it knows what a browser is.

/**
 * The long edge every measurement is taken at, and the reason the thresholds below are numbers
 * rather than opinions.
 *
 * A 12 MP phone photograph is around 4000x3000. Convolving twelve million pixels on the main thread
 * of a low-end handset is a visible freeze at exactly the moment the designer wants to take the next
 * picture, and it is unnecessary: defocus is a LOW-frequency phenomenon — a photograph that is
 * genuinely out of focus is still obviously out of focus at 640px, because the blur radius scales
 * down with everything else. 640 on the long edge is ~307k pixels for a 4:3 frame, about forty times
 * less arithmetic than full size.
 *
 * TWO CONSEQUENCES, BOTH DELIBERATE.
 *
 * First, the blur threshold is meaningless without this number: variance of the Laplacian depends
 * entirely on the scale it is measured at, so moving this constant invalidates
 * {@link BLUR_VARIANCE_FLOOR} and the calibration in e2e/image-quality.spec.ts must be re-run.
 * They move together or not at all.
 *
 * Second, downscaling is itself a low-pass filter, so a photograph that is only SLIGHTLY soft looks
 * sharp here — a 4px blur at 4000px wide is a 0.64px blur at 640px, which is nothing. That is a
 * deliberate bias toward silence, not an oversight: this check is meant to catch the photograph that
 * is badly out of focus, and to say nothing at all about the marginal ones.
 */
export const WORK_EDGE_PX = 640;

/**
 * Below this the "blurred" warning is withheld no matter how low the Laplacian variance is, because
 * the measure stops meaning anything.
 *
 * Variance of the Laplacian scales with the square of the image's own contrast, so a PERFECTLY sharp
 * photograph of a low-contrast subject scores like a blurred one. That is not a rare corner in this
 * archive — undyed cotton on a white sheet, raw bamboo against a mud wall and a pale terracotta pot
 * in flat shade are all ordinary craft documentation, and all of them are low-contrast by nature.
 * Warning on those would train designers to ignore the warning, which costs more than the blurred
 * photographs it would have caught.
 *
 * So contrast is measured first (the standard deviation of the luma plane, 0–255), and where there
 * is too little of it for the blur measure to discriminate, this module says nothing rather than
 * guessing.
 *
 * MEASURED, in e2e/image-quality.spec.ts: a perfectly sharp 1/f field scaled to a flat subject
 * scores a blur variance of 57 — below {@link BLUR_VARIANCE_FLOOR}, i.e. it WOULD be reported as
 * blurred — at a contrast of 9.0. Blurring, by contrast, barely moves this number at all (a
 * photo-like field measures 32.2 sharp and 29.6 after a radius-4 blur), because defocus removes
 * high-frequency detail and leaves the overall spread of tones intact. That asymmetry is what makes
 * contrast a safe guard: it can distinguish "flat" from "unfocused", so withholding the warning
 * below 12 costs no genuine blur detections while removing the one false positive that matters.

 * The variance-of-Laplacian score below which a photograph is called blurred, measured on a
 * {@link WORK_EDGE_PX} greyscale downscale.
 *
 * CALIBRATED, NOT ASSERTED. Every number below was measured by e2e/image-quality.spec.ts at
 * {@link WORK_EDGE_PX}, and that spec fails if the separation this constant depends on stops
 * holding:
 *
 *   SHARP                                          BLURRED (same sources, box blur radius 1/2/4)
 *   1/f "photo-like" field, seed 1337 ....  733     .......................  5.1 /  2.4 /  1.8
 *   1/f "photo-like" field, seed 90210 ...  807     .......................  5.5 /  2.4 /  1.8
 *   real JPEG through the browser decoder  15473    real JPEG, 6px Gaussian  ..........  56.3
 *   real 12 MP JPEG, browser decoder .....  9308
 *   checkerboard, 8px cells .............. 40106    (synthetic ceiling, not a photograph)
 *
 * So the entire realistic sharp population sits at 733 and above, and everything genuinely out of
 * focus sits at 56.3 and below — a gap of more than an order of magnitude with nothing in it. 60 is
 * placed at the BOTTOM of that gap, hard against the blurred population rather than in the middle.
 *
 * That asymmetry is the whole design. A missed blurred photograph costs one photograph. A false
 * "this is blurred" on a photograph that is perfectly sharp costs the feature: a designer who is
 * wrongly warned twice stops reading warnings, and then the real one goes past unread too. At 60 the
 * lowest realistic sharp score clears the line by a factor of twelve, which is the margin that
 * absorbs the low-detail subjects this corpus does not contain — a plain pot against a plain wall is
 * sharp and carries far less edge energy than any sample above. The cost of that choice is real and
 * accepted: photographs that are only slightly soft score in the hundreds and pass unremarked. Do
 * not "tighten" this number toward the middle of the gap without re-running the calibration and
 * thinking again about which of the two errors this feature can afford.

/**
 * The long edge a photograph needs to survive being printed as a plate in the generated report.
 *
 * DERIVED FROM THE REPORT'S OWN GEOMETRY, not from a rule of thumb. The report is A4 with 25mm
 * margins (`report_model.py` `sizeMm` / `margin_mm`), so the text column — and therefore a
 * full-width plate at `width_pct: 100` — is 160mm, or 6.2992in of paper (`report_docx.py`
 * `text_w_mm`, and the identical figures in Android's `DocxWriter.kt` and the web preview's
 * `previewModel.ts`). The full-width landscape plate is the binding case: the portrait height cap of
 * 153mm needs fewer pixels, and every multi-up gallery cell needs far fewer.
 *
 * The dpi to multiply it by is the one figure this repository actually commits to:
 * `report_raster.RENDER_DPI = 200.0`, the resolution the app rasterises its own maps and charts at,
 * mirrored in Kotlin as a value that "must equal report_raster.RENDER_DPI". 6.2992in × 200dpi = 1260
 * pixels; 1280 is that rounded up.
 *
 * WHY NOT THE 300 DPI PRINT STANDARD, which would put this at 1890. Because a warning has to be
 * unarguable to survive being read twice. Below 1280 a photograph provably cannot fill the plate at
 * the resolution this app itself considers adequate — there is nothing to debate. Between 1280 and
 * 1890 it merely falls short of commercial offset print, which is a real but arguable concern, and
 * firing there would flag a great many photographs that look perfectly good in the delivered
 * document. Silence is the better answer in that band. (Note that photographs are embedded in the
 * report at their original size and never resampled — nothing downstream will rescue a small one,
 * which is why saying so at capture time is the only chance anybody gets.)
 *
 * Stated rather than hidden: the warning quotes both this figure and the reason, because "too small"
 * with no number tells a designer nothing they can act on, whereas "1024x768 — a catalogue plate
 * needs about 1280px on the long edge" tells them whether to re-shoot and at what setting.

/**
 * Decode `file` and measure it, or return null when this browser cannot.
 *
 * KEEPING THE MAIN THREAD FREE, which on a low-end handset is the difference between a check nobody
 * notices and a camera button that stops responding:
 *
 * - `createImageBitmap` decodes OFF the main thread in every engine that has it, so the expensive
 *   part of a 12 MP JPEG never runs where the UI does.
 * - The second `createImageBitmap` resizes off-thread too, and the full-size bitmap is `close()`d the
 *   instant it has been read. A 4000x3000 decode is ~48 MB of RGBA; holding two of those on a cheap
 *   phone while the designer takes the next photograph is how a tab gets killed.
 * - Only the working-size plane — 640px on the long edge — is ever convolved, and that runs on the
 *   main thread because at that size it is sub-millisecond arithmetic. A worker would cost a second
 *   copy of the pixels and a message round-trip to save less than the copy costs.
 *
 * Failure is always silent and always null. A photograph in a format this browser will not decode is
 * a photograph with no findings, never an error in front of the designer — the file is fine and the
 * upload is already on its way.
