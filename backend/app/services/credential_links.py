"""THE PASSWORD LINK: a one-off, single-use address that lets somebody set their own password.

Ported from ``C:/dev/cxa-cms/lib/auth/credential-token.ts``, which is the canonical minting of this
construction. Read that file before changing anything here; the four properties it argues for are
kept intact and three of them are the reason this is not a JWT.

── WHAT WAS PORTED, VERBATIM IN SUBSTANCE ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

1. **NOT A SESSION TOKEN.** ``core.security.create_access_token`` mints the credential the whole API
   authorises against. Anything shaped like one risks being accepted as one by a call site that
   checks only a signature, so this is a different construction — ``base64url(payload) "."
   base64url(HMAC-SHA256(payload))`` — that no bearer-token path can parse.
2. **THE FINGERPRINT, WHICH IS WHAT MAKES IT SINGLE-USE.** The payload carries 16 hex characters of
   a SHA-256 of the account's password hash at minting time. Setting a password changes the hash,
   so every link minted before it stops verifying — immediately, with nothing having to remember.
   An account with NO password digests a fixed sentinel, so an invitation is bound to "still has no
   password". The digest is never enough to attack the hash and is enough to notice a change.
3. **EXPIRY IS INSIDE THE SIGNED PAYLOAD**, so a stale link is refused without a database read, and
   the reason can be reported honestly to somebody holding a link that has simply gone cold.
4. **SESSION REVOCATION ON RESET.** Redeeming a link writes ``User.sessionsValidFrom``, which
   ``deps._user_from_bearer`` compares every token's ``iat`` against. The reason somebody is
   resetting is usually that a session they no longer control exists somewhere. Since 2026-10-09
   :func:`credential_fingerprint` binds the bearer tokens too (``security.CREDENTIAL_CLAIM``), so a
   new password retires the sessions opened with the old one whichever door wrote it — one
   definition of "the password changed", for links and for sessions.

── WHAT WAS DELIBERATELY NOT PORTED ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

**cxa-cms HAS NO THROTTLE ON ISSUING, AND THAT IS A HOLE THIS DOES NOT COPY.** Because minting is
free and redeeming revokes sessions, an administrator there can sign a colleague out of their own
laptop as often as they can click. :data:`ISSUE_BUDGET` and :data:`ISSUE_WINDOW_HOURS` close it:
per-SUBJECT, not per-admin, because the person being harmed is the subject and two admins taking
turns is the same harm.

**THE TOKEN IS NEVER RETURNED AS A SEPARATE FIELD BESIDE THE LINK.** cxa-cms's canonical route
refuses to, on the stated grounds that a credential appearing twice in one answer is a credential in
two places to keep out of logs. Honoured: :func:`issue_link` hands back the LINK, and the token
exists inside it.

── THE ONE THING THAT IS NEW HERE: A TABLE ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────

cxa-cms is deliberately tableless. ``PasswordResetToken`` exists here because the owner asked for
revocation, a throttle and an audit trail, and a stateless token can express none of the three — see
that model's docstring. **It does not replace the fingerprint**; both checks run, and the
fingerprint is still what makes a redeemed link dead even if the row is never read again.

── DELIVERY ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

Two transports implement :class:`CredentialDelivery`. :class:`CopyLinkDelivery` hands the link
back to the administrator to copy — the owner's choice of 2026-08-30, and still the default.
:class:`EmailDelivery` (2026-10-10) queues the link to the account's own address through
``email_outbox`` and hands the administrator NO link: one copy of a credential, in the inbox of the
person it is for. It is offered only when mail is configured (``mailer.mail_configured``). The link
travels to the worker Fernet-sealed and the seal is cleared once the message is sent or has failed;
no log line carries it.

    a hash, so the old rule ("INVITE while the hash is NULL") handed its holder a two-hour RESET link —
    read on a Monday, dead by lunch. ``firstLoginAt`` is NULL until the first sign-in that actually
    got in (``auth.login``), so an account carrying a hash and no first login is still an invitation
    in every sense that matters, and the sanction register already treated its unused accounts so.

    Every account in use before then carries a NULL it never earned, and reading that as "never

    seventy-two-hour INVITE in place of the two-hour RESET — thirty-six times the window in which a
    mis-pasted link takes over a live account. No backfill (no migration in this change), so the
    rule asks for POSITIVE evidence of an unused account: a NULL first login on an account created
    after the stamp began. Anything else with a password is RESET, as it was before this change; an
    account with no password is INVITE, as it always was.

    THE REASON INVITE IS NOT USED FOR EVERYBODY STILL HOLDS: once somebody has signed in, the account
